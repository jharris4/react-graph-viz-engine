React component for visualizing graph data.

## Getting Started
This project wraps the library in a Storybook UI. [More information on Storybook here](https://storybook.js.org/).

The Storybook provides examples  for each of the functionalities this library provides. For each of these examples, you can :
* Change the config parameters in the "Controls" tab and see how they affect the visualization ;
* Get the corresponding JSX definition of the React component
